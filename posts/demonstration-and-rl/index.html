A simple behavior cloning, with a few tricks, can definitely go a long way – it can generate a policy for relatively complex manipulation tasks with just a few demonstrations. However, relying soley on demonstration alone can be problematic when it comes to the issue of domain shift: when the robot goes outside of the lab – outside the data distribution – the trained policy is highly likely to fail.\nReinforcement learning (RL), on the other hand, is way better at creating robust policies by actively exploring the world for better actions. However, although it might be not be physically taxing, engineering an RL policy can still be a mentally taxing process. It requires carefully creating the simulation environment, shaping the reward/action/state space to make the agent efficiently explore, and most importantly, it is not an intuitive process to do which often requires multiple engineering iterations.\nCombining demonstration dataset for reinforcement learning – LfD x RL – is thus very promising in many ways. Demonstration can serve as a good guidance for the agent while exploring the world, and such exploration can help us achieve the level of robustness that cannot be achieved training solely on demonstration.\nPossible workflows Although it’s often overlooked in many LfD x RL papers, there are many ways how demonstrations can be combined with RL in the context of real-world robotics deployment. Based on how we collect the demonstration and where the agent explores, six type of workflows can be studied.\nDemonstrate in → Explore in ↓ Simulation\n(w/ robot action) Real-world\n(w/ human action) Real-world\n(w/ robot action) Simulation type A ★ type B type C Real-world type D type E type F ★ Table 1. Possible workflows for demonstration + RL Demonstrate and Explore in the same world Type A and Type F is the case where most of the existing LfD x RL literatures deal with — a workflow where the demonstration and exploration happens in the same world. It is the most clean setup to study since both are subject to the same governing physics, same state/action space, and the same environment setup. However, both of these approach has some practical limitations.\nType A : Data collection and RL exploration is all done in simulation.\nData Collection in Sim Exploration in Sim Pros 👍 data collection pipeline can leverage simulation privileges (e.g. easy resets, automated data collection or post-augmentation using oracles) exploration cost is cheap and can leverage many simulation privileges (e.g. resets, oracle states) Cons 👎 cannot collect demonstrations for tasks that cannot be simulated (e.g. deformables) final policy lives in a simulation — Sim2Real is required! Type F : Data collection and RL exploration is all done in real-world.\nData Collection in Real-world Exploration in Real-world Pros 👍 can collect demonstrations for any tasks that law of physics allowcan collect high-quality demonstrations with real-world data points no need to deal with sim-to-real issues: the final policy lives in the real-world! Cons 👎 cost of data collection can be expensive – cannot be sped up, the environment should be manually be resetted every time all the hassles involved with doing real-world RL (e.g. manual resets…) comes back. Demonstrate and Explore in different worlds One other promising alternative is type C, which can be a practical choice to consider when collecting real-world demonstration is relatively easier.\nType C : Data is collected in real-world, but exploration is done in simulation. This naturally combines the strength of each approach – leveraging realistic, high-quality demonstrations in real-world, and cheap interaction costs of the simulation.\nData Collection in Real-world Exploration in Simulation Pros 👍 - can collect demonstrations for any tasks that law of physics allows - can collect high-quality demonstrations with real-world data points no need to deal with sim-to-real issues: the final policy lives in the real-world! Cons 👎 cost of data collection can be expensive – cannot be sped up, the environment should be manually be resetted every time all the hassles involved with doing real-world RL (e.g. manual resets…) comes back. data collection: 👎 : demonstration tasks are being limited by simulation capabilities (since the exploration happens in the simulation) 👎 : cost of data collection can be expensive – cannot be sped up, the environment should be manually be resetted every time 👎 : should deal with discrepancies between real-world vs simulation environment setup – either being the discrepancy in physics, asset modeling, … type F also does fall into this category, but it is a bit more interesting:\nType F: Data is collected in simulation, but exploration is done in real-world.
