Motivation Paradigm Shift | Robotics community is currently facing a rapid paradigm shift: with better network architectures and new generative modeling techniques, learning-from-demonstration (LfD) approach is gaining its popularity all over again. We are seeing a lot of existential proofs showing that robots can indeed do many things autonomously in a reasonably realistic setting, using human-collected real-world demonstrations and relatively simple behavior cloning methods (with a few new tricks).\n(left) Mobile-ALOHA (right) Diffusion Policies “What we need is just more data,” is thus what many people in the community seems to believe these days. Betting on the Bitter Lesson, people are claiming that general embodied intelligence can only be obtained by learning things from a large-scale embodied dataset, not by any other means. RT-X and its following papers can somehow be considered as an initial clue showing that scaling laws actually do apply in real-world robotics; a faint signal indicating that this is indeed the right way to go.\nHow are we going to collect the data, however, is still an open question that deserves more attention. I love the argument that Emo Todorov made during a debate happened at one CoRL workshop last year:\n“You can be a problem solver, or you can be a librarian, and both are valuable professions.” – But if everyone wants to become a librarian, who’s gonna be the problem solver and fill in the books inside the library?\nWell, if our goal is to add a single book – a sensorimotor behavior for a single task – to the library, there are many ways to do so. In fact, this is what robotics grad students are doing everyday — pick a robot, set a target task, record a demo video, publish a paper – and everytime the robot moves and succeeds to do something, we are basically generating a demonstration data. The method we use can largely be fitted into two categories: (a) using optimal control algorithms, (b) collecting human demonstrations, or, in some cases, both.\n1. Using Optimal Control Solvers The former approach formulates the task as an optimal control problem and uses well-established solvers, i.e., reinforcement learning or a model-predictive control. It works in many cases: with all the right pre-requisites, i.e., well-designed simulation environment or a well-approximated model with the right objective function, people have found reasonably optimal solutions even for extremely complex tasks [rubiks cube, dexterity]. However, the amount of engineering efforts required in the process is often surprisingly high, making this approach less practical than one thinks. Such human engineering efforts, most importantly, is not intuitive. It requires deep understanding of the problem and the solution technique you’re applying, often requiring large computational resources as well.\n2. Using Human Demonstrations The latter approach instead relies more on our intuitive physical intelligence (obtained through our long history of evolution) and directly collects human behaviors using teleoperation. This obviously requires a lot of physical labor which cannot be sped-up by any means. However, given that we’re working with the right teleoperation interface, this approach is way more intuitive. In fact, such intuitiveness ironically makes this labor-intensive approach the most economically viable and feasible option to currently pursue: hiring a healthy human to wear optitrack suits while doing everyday-task is way cheaper than hiring a team of robotics PhDs to develop and run RL or MPC algorithms for a single task.\nData Collection Operator, Tesla Bot | Tesla Careers\nScaling up | However, it’s hard to expect things to scale this way – it’s nearly impossible to meaningfully cover all possible environment and task space if obtaining a single data point requires either extensive physical labor or unintuitive engineering iterations. The key to scaling up the data library is to reduce or entirely remove the human efforts required to generate the data.\nWIP from here\nAutomating Optimal Control Solvers | This post thus discusses the problem of automating behavior generation using optimal control solvers, i.e., reinforcement learning or MPC. It will introduce terminologies, technical problems in robotics, possibly targetting non-robotics audiences. The rest of the section will include:\nSection 2: Problem Definition\nclearly define the input / output of the pipline $$\\mathcal{G}: \\mathcal{E}_R \\times \\mathcal{F} \\rightarrow \\tau^\\star = (s_0, a_0, \\cdots, s_n)$$ real-world target environment $\\mathcal{E}_R$ that already exists (including the choice of robot) target task described as a fitness function $\\mathcal{F}: \\tau \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ discussion point: should the output be a “policy” or “demonstration” note: policy can always be converted to a demonstration – policy is more advanced requirement Section 2: Jobs to Automate\nList up individual jobs that should be automated both in simulation-based RL / MPC framework in the specific case of IsaacGym and MJPC show how vulnerable MPC/RL algorithms are to each jobs via experiments there are two types of tasks: importing vs designing. Section 3: Automating Jobs\nList existing techniques required to automate each jobs Discuss it’s limitations – Eureka experiments Section 4: Global Optimization Strategy $$\\min_{\\omega_1, \\omega_2, \\cdots, \\omega_n}\\mathcal{R}$$ $$\\min_{\\omega_1}\\mathcal{R}, \\min_{\\omega_2}\\mathcal{R}, \\cdots, \\min_{\\omega_n}\\mathcal{R}$$ $$\\min_{\\omega_1}\\mathcal{R(\\cdot | \\omega_2, \\cdots, \\omega_n)}, \\min_{\\omega_n}\\mathcal{R(\\cdot | \\omega_1, \\cdots, \\omega_{n-1})}$$\nDiscuss that ABG is rather a global optimization problem over each components, rather than a sequentially optimizable problem – Section 5: Automation Benchmarks\nCome up with a benchmark where non-robotics people can jump in and contribute easily. 2. Jobs to Automate Basically, the job $$\\mathcal{M}:=\\left \u003c S, A, T, R, \\gamma \\right \u003e $$ $$\\pi= \\mathcal{F}(\\mathcal{M})$$\nand there are two types of Jobs\nImport: a job where one has to exactly import a real-world counterpart inside a simulation Design: a job where one has to come up and design something, without any real-world counterparts to consider, leveraging a simulation environment with relatively cheaper experiment costs. Import | For importing-type of jobs, there exists a real-world counterpart of interest that we’re trying to import inside the simulation. Nothing’s being “unconditionally” generated inside a simulation — everything that’s imported inside the simulation is a duplicate of a real-world target scenario, with minimal alteration. It can be described as creating a “digital-twin” for corresponding real-world component — the more accurate the digital twin is, the better.\nCreating a digital twin — importing — can thus be construed as a problem of system identification in a larger sense; adopting a data-driven approach, importing jobs can be described as a supervised learning problem of:\n$$\\hat{\\omega} = \\argmin_{\\omega} \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathcal{\\mathbf{x} \\sim X}} ~\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{x};\\omega)$$\nwhere $\\omega$ is the imported model of a real-world counterpart, $\\mathcal{L}$ is an error-criterion that measures the discrepancy between the two, and a train set $\\mathcal{X}$ containing a real-world data point. Note that the imported model $\\omega$ can take diverse forms; (stochasticity) it can be a probabilistic distribution, or a deterministic model (function) it can be a function or a variable.\nDesign | Unlike importing jobs, jobs that fall into this category doesn’t have any real-world counterpart that we can use as a definitive north star. Instead, the objective function of this design becomes a bit more global and higher-level, which is to\n$$\\hat{\\omega} = \\arg\\min_{\\omega} \\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim \\mathcal{X}} \\mathcal{R}(x;\\omega, \\mathcal{T})$$\nbut the objective function $\\mathcal{R}$ is less obvious than importing jobs — where one important distinction is that it depends on the task $\\mathcal{T}$ we’re trying to solve.\n2.1. Agent In the context of simulation-based robotic behavior generation, setting up an agent is basically a job of importing the robot we’re using inside a simulation, which includes a subtask of: (a) link geometry modeling, (b) robot kinematics modeling and (c) robot dynamics modeling.\nThis is relatively a hassle-free job when using commercially available robots, since the manufacturer usually accompanies a pretty-much accurate robot description file (e.g. URDF, MJCF) that contains sufficient parameters that most modern simulators can use to populate a working robot kinematics and dynamics model.\nIf one’s working on a custom-designed robot, one must at least once go through the process of writing down its own robot description file — fundamentally speaking, modeling its robot kinematics and dynamics that we can simulate.\nAlthough first-principle based system identification methods are commonly preferred over the data-driven approach for many reasons, robot model identifcation can still be done with the same importing framework described above (Wensing et al., 2022):\n$f_\\theta$ represents the robot kinematics/dynamics model\n$$q_{t+1} = f_\\theta(q_t, u_t)$$\ntest set $\\mathcal{X}$ includes a set of actuation trajectoriess $\\tilde{u}_{t=1:T}$ and its corresponding ground truth real-world responses $\\tilde{s}_{t=1:T}$\n$$\\mathcal{X} = \\{ x_i =(\\tilde{u}_{t=1:T_i}, \\tilde{q}_{t=1:T_i}) | i \\in [1,n] \\}$$\nerror-criterion $\\mathcal{L}$ being defined as, for instance, discrepancy between integral curves, i.e.,\n$$\\mathcal{L}(x_i;f, \\theta) = \\sum_{t=1}^{T_i} \\left | \\tilde{q}_t - q_t \\right |^2 \\\\q_{t+1} = f_\\theta(q_{t}, \\tilde{u_t}), ~ q_0 = \\tilde{q}_0$$\n(P.S. there can be multiple possible choices of error criterion for robot dynamics/kinematics calibration)\n2.2. Environment Environment setup job involves three subtasks: (a) importing assets, (b) designing arrangement distributions, and (c) designing randomization strategies.\n2.2.1. Assets\nFirst subtask is to import a real-world asset of interest inside a simulation, which involves modeling both the geometric and physical properties of an object.\nImporting a geometric property (3D shape) of an object is a well-studied topic in computer vision domain. Given a 3D capture of an object,\n2.2.2. Arrangement Distributions\n2.2.3. Randomization Strategies\n2.3. Contact 2.4. Control This is a place where we setup an MDP —\n$$ \\mathcal{M} = { \\mathcal{S}, \\mathcal{A}, r, \\mathcal{P}, \\mathcal{S_0}, t} $$\nwhich is basically a design problem over state space, action space, and a reward function. Note that state transition probability\n2.3.1. State Space $\\mathcal{S}$\n2.3.2. Action Space $\\mathcal{A}$\nThis subsection might not be straightforward for many non-robotics people, since it seems like we already defined an actuation space $\\mathcal{U}$ and identified every required parameters. However, most successful robotics deployment cases of RL-driven behavior generations do not directly learn with the raw control input space $\\mathcal{U}$, but instead devises a clever action space and control strategy — Why can’t we just use the raw actuation for our RL agent’s action space? Why do we need a separate action space and a control method?\nThe control input space $\\mathcal{U}$ used for modeling the robot dynamics and kinematics\n$$ s_{t+1} = f_\\theta(s_t, u_t), ~ u_t \\in \\mathcal{U} $$\nis usually the lowest-level actuation possible for a given hardware, i.e., motor-level torque — the “atomic” electric signal that drives the movement of the motor. However, depending on the task, it is often the case where we lift up the control inputs to a more tractable action space, either being a subspace of joint-space or configuration-space. This creates one additional layer inside the actuation process, where our higher-level action $a_t\\in\\mathcal{A}$ are again converted to a motor-level torque $u_t \\in \\mathcal{U}$ using a closed-loop control.\n$$ u_t = g_\\theta(a_t; s_t) $$\nOne easiest example is a joint-level PID controller, where $a_t = (q_t^d, \\dot{q}_t^d)$ is now defined by the desired joint position and velocity:\n$$ u_t = k_p (q_t^d - q_t) + k_d (\\dot{q}_t^d - \\dot{q}_t) + k_i \\int_0 ^t (q^d - q ) dt. $$\nwhere most simulators\nOne more often used case, especially for non-contact rich robot manipulation tasks, are operational space control (OSC) — where $a_t = (\\mathbf{x}^d_t, \\dot{\\mathbf{x}}^d_t)$ is now defined by desired spatial pose and velocity:\n$$ u_t = J^T_{ee}(q)M_{x_{ee}}(q) [k_p (\\mathbf{x}^d_t - \\mathbf{x}_t) + k_v (\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}^d_t - \\dot{\\mathbf{x}}_t)] + g(q) $$\nwhere $J,M$ are each Jacobians and mass matrix corresponding to the end-effector.\n2.3.3.

In fact, such intuitiveness ironically makes this labor-intensive approach the most economically viable and feasible option to currently pursue: hiring a healthy human to wear optitrack suits while doing everyday-task is way cheaper than hiring a team of robotics PhDs to develop and run RL or MPC algorithms for a single task.</p><center><figure><img loading=lazy src=https://share.cleanshot.com/t7626K2n+ alt="Data Collection Operator, Tesla Bot | Tesla Careers" width=80%><figcaption><p>Data Collection Operator, Tesla Bot | <a href=https://www.tesla.com/careers/search/job/data-collection-operator-tesla-bot-swing-shift-213194>Tesla Careers</a></p></figcaption></figure></center><p><strong>Scaling up</strong> | However, it’s hard to expect things to scale this way &ndash; it&rsquo;s nearly impossible to meaningfully cover all possible environment and task space if obtaining a single data point requires either extensive physical labor or unintuitive engineering iterations. <strong>The key to scaling up the data library is to reduce or entirely remove the human efforts required to generate the data.</strong></p><hr><p>WIP from here</p><p><strong>Automating Optimal Control Solvers</strong>   |   This post thus discusses the problem of automating behavior generation using optimal control solvers, i.e., reinforcement learning or MPC.

Jobs to Automate<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-jobs-to-automate>#</a></h2><p>Basically, the job
$$\mathcal{M}:=\left &lt; S, A, T, R, \gamma \right > $$
$$\pi= \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{M})$$</p><p>and there are two types of Jobs</p><ul><li><strong>Import:</strong> a job where one has to exactly <em>import</em> a real-world counterpart inside a simulation</li><li><strong>Design:</strong> a job where one has to come up and <em>design</em> something, without any real-world counterparts to consider, leveraging a simulation environment with relatively cheaper experiment costs.</li></ul><p><strong>Import</strong> | For <em>importing</em>-type of jobs, there exists a real-world counterpart of interest that we’re trying to import inside the simulation. Nothing’s being “unconditionally” generated inside a simulation — everything that’s <em>imported</em> inside the simulation is a duplicate of a real-world target scenario, with minimal alteration. It can be described as creating a “digital-twin” for corresponding real-world component — the more accurate the digital twin is, the better.</p><p>Creating a digital twin — <em>importing</em> — can thus be construed as a problem of <em>system identification</em> in a larger sense; adopting a data-driven approach, <em>importing</em> jobs can be described as a supervised learning problem of:</p><p>$$\hat{\omega} = \argmin_{\omega} \mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{\mathbf{x} \sim X}} ~\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{x};\omega)$$</p><p>where $\omega$ is the imported model of a real-world counterpart, $\mathcal{L}$ is an error-criterion that measures the discrepancy between the two, and a train set $\mathcal{X}$ containing a real-world data point. Note that the imported model $\omega$ can take diverse forms; (stochasticity) it can be a probabilistic distribution, or a deterministic model (function) it can be a function or a variable.</p><p><strong>Design</strong> | Unlike <em>importing</em> jobs, jobs that fall into this category doesn’t have any real-world counterpart that we can use as a definitive north star. Instead, the objective function of this design becomes a bit more global and higher-level, which is to</p><p>$$\hat{\omega} = \arg\min_{\omega} \mathbb{E}_{x \sim \mathcal{X}} \mathcal{R}(x;\omega, \mathcal{T})$$</p><p>but the objective function $\mathcal{R}$ is less obvious than <em>importing</em> jobs — where one important distinction is that it depends on the task $\mathcal{T}$ we’re trying to solve.</p><h3 id=21-agent>2.1. Agent<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#21-agent>#</a></h3><p>In the context of simulation-based robotic behavior generation, setting up an agent is basically a job of <strong>importing</strong> the robot we’re using inside a simulation, which includes a subtask of: (a) link geometry modeling, (b) robot kinematics modeling and (c) robot dynamics modeling.</p><p>This is relatively a hassle-free job when using commercially available robots, since the manufacturer usually accompanies a pretty-much accurate robot description file (e.g. URDF, MJCF) that contains sufficient parameters that most modern simulators can use to populate a working robot kinematics and dynamics model.</p><p>If one’s working on a custom-designed robot, one must at least once go through the process of writing down its own robot description file — fundamentally speaking, modeling its robot kinematics and dynamics that we can simulate.</p><p>Although first-principle based system identification methods are commonly preferred over the data-driven approach for many reasons, robot model identifcation can still be done with the same <em>importing</em> framework described above (Wensing et al., 2022):</p><ul><li><p>$f_\theta$ represents the robot kinematics/dynamics model</p><p>$$q_{t+1} = f_\theta(q_t, u_t)$$</p></li><li><p>test set $\mathcal{X}$ includes a set of actuation trajectoriess $\tilde{u}_{t=1:T}$ and its corresponding ground truth real-world responses $\tilde{s}_{t=1:T}$</p><p>$$\mathcal{X} = \{ x_i =(\tilde{u}_{t=1:T_i}, \tilde{q}_{t=1:T_i}) | i \in [1,n] \}$$</p></li><li><p>error-criterion $\mathcal{L}$ being defined as, for instance, discrepancy between integral curves, i.e.,</p><p>$$\mathcal{L}(x_i;f, \theta) = \sum_{t=1}^{T_i} \left | \tilde{q}_t - q_t \right |^2 \\q_{t+1} = f_\theta(q_{t}, \tilde{u_t}), ~ q_0 = \tilde{q}_0$$</p><p>(P.S. there can be multiple possible choices of error criterion for robot dynamics/kinematics calibration)</p></li></ul><h3 id=22--environment>2.2. Environment<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#22--environment>#</a></h3><p>Environment setup job involves three subtasks: (a) <em><strong>importing</strong></em> assets, (b) <em><strong>designing</strong></em> arrangement distributions, and (c) <em><strong>designing</strong></em> randomization strategies.</p><p><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>2.2.1. Assets</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></p><p>First subtask is to import a real-world asset of interest inside a simulation, which involves modeling both the geometric and physical properties of an object.</p><p>Importing a geometric property (3D shape) of an object is a well-studied topic in computer vision domain.

\mathcal{M} = { \mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, r, \mathcal{P}, \mathcal{S_0}, t}
$$</p><p>which is basically a design problem over state space, action space, and a reward function. Note that state transition probability</p><p><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>2.3.1. State Space</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> $\mathcal{S}$</p><p><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>2.3.2. Action Space</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> $\mathcal{A}$</p><p>This subsection might not be straightforward for many non-robotics people, since it seems like we already defined an actuation space $\mathcal{U}$ and identified every required parameters. However, most successful robotics deployment cases of RL-driven behavior generations do not directly learn with the raw control input space $\mathcal{U}$, but instead devises a clever action space and control strategy — Why can’t we just use the raw actuation for our RL agent’s action space? Why do we need a separate action space and a control method?</p><p>The control input space $\mathcal{U}$ used for modeling the robot dynamics and kinematics</p><p>$$
s_{t+1} = f_\theta(s_t, u_t), ~ u_t \in \mathcal{U}
$$</p><p>is usually the lowest-level actuation possible for a given hardware, i.e., motor-level torque — the “atomic” electric signal that drives the movement of the motor. However, depending on the task, it is often the case where we lift up the control inputs to a more tractable action space, either being a subspace of joint-space or configuration-space. This creates one additional layer inside the actuation process, where our higher-level action $a_t\in\mathcal{A}$ are again converted to a motor-level torque $u_t \in \mathcal{U}$ using a closed-loop control.</p><p>$$
u_t = g_\theta(a_t; s_t)
$$</p><p>One easiest example is a joint-level PID controller, where $a_t = (q_t^d, \dot{q}_t^d)$ is now defined by the desired joint position and velocity:</p><p>$$
u_t = k_p (q_t^d - q_t) + k_d (\dot{q}_t^d - \dot{q}_t) + k_i \int_0 ^t (q^d - q ) dt.
$$</p><p>where most simulators</p><p>One more often used case, especially for non-contact rich robot manipulation tasks, are operational space control (OSC) — where $a_t = (\mathbf{x}^d_t, \dot{\mathbf{x}}^d_t)$ is now defined by desired spatial pose and velocity:</p><p>$$
u_t = J^T_{ee}(q)M_{x_{ee}}(q) [k_p (\mathbf{x}^d_t - \mathbf{x}_t) + k_v (\dot{\mathbf{x}}^d_t - \dot{\mathbf{x}}_t)] + g(q)
$$</p><p>where $J,M$ are each Jacobians and mass matrix corresponding to the end-effector.</p><p><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>2.3.3.
