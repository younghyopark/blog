Motivation Paradigm Shift | Robotics community is currently facing a rapid paradigm shift: with better network architectures and new generative modeling techniques, learning-from-demonstration (LfD) approach is gaining its popularity all over again. We are seeing a lot of existential proofs showing that robots can indeed do many things autonomously in a reasonably realistic setting, using human-collected real-world demonstrations and relatively simple behavior cloning methods (with a few new tricks).\n(left) Mobile-ALOHA (right) Diffusion Policies “What we need is just more data,” is thus what many people in the community seems to believe these days. Betting on the Bitter Lesson, people are claiming that general embodied intelligence can only be obtained by learning things from a large-scale embodied dataset, not by any other means. RT-X and its following papers can somehow be considered as an initial clue showing that scaling laws actually do apply in real-world robotics; a faint signal indicating that this is indeed the right way to go.\nHow are we going to collect the data, however, is still an open question that deserves more attention. I love the argument that Emo Todorov made during a debate happened at one CoRL workshop last year:\n“You can be a problem solver, or you can be a librarian, and both are valuable professions.” – But if everyone wants to become a librarian, who’s gonna be the problem solver and fill in the books inside the library?\nWell, if our goal is to add a single book – a sensorimotor behavior for a single task – to the library, there are many ways to do so. In fact, this is what robotics grad students are doing everyday — pick a robot, set a target task, record a demo video, publish a paper – and everytime the robot moves and succeeds to do something, we are basically generating a demonstration data. The method we use is not that crazy or creative as well – popular approaches can largely fit into two categories: (a) using optimal control algorithms, (b) collecting human demonstrations, or, in some cases, both.\n1. Using Optimal Control Solver The former approach formulates the task as an optimal control problem and uses well-established solvers, i.e., reinforcement learning or a model-predictive control. It works in many cases: with all the right pre-requisites, i.e., well-designed simulation environment or a well-approximated model with the right objective function, people have found reasonably optimal solutions even for extremely complex tasks [rubiks cube, dexterity]. However, the amount of engineering efforts required in the process is often surprisingly high, making this approach less practical than one thinks. Such human engineering efforts, most importantly, is not intuitive. It requires deep understanding of the problem and the solution technique you’re applying, often requiring large computational resources as well.\n2. Using Human Demonstrations The latter approach instead relies more on our intuitive physical intelligence (obtained through our long history of evolution) and directly collects human behaviors using teleoperation. This obviously requires a lot of physical labor which cannot be sped-up by any means. However, given that we’re working with the right teleoperation interface, this approach is way more intuitive. In fact, such intuitiveness ironically makes this labor-intensive approach the most economically viable and feasible option to currently pursue: hiring a healthy human to wear optitrack suits while doing everyday-task is way cheaper than hiring a team of robotics PhDs to develop and run RL or MPC algorithms for a single task.\nData Collection Operator, Tesla Bot | Tesla Careers\nScaling up | However, it’s hard to expect things to scale this way – it’s nearly impossible to meaningfully cover all possible environment and task space if obtaining a single data point requires either extensive physical labor or unintuitive engineering iterations. The key to scaling up the data library is to reduce or entirely remove the human efforts required to generate the data.\nAutomating Optimal Control Solvers | This post thus discusses the problem of automating the process of generating behaviors using optimal control solvers, i.e., reinforcement learning or MPC. The rest of the section will include:\nSection 2: Jobs to Automate List up individual jobs that should be automated show how vulnerable MPC/RL algorithms are to each jobs there are two types of tasks: importing vs designing. Section 3: Problem Definition Section 4: Automation Techniques Section 5: Limitations and Examples Section 6: reinforcement learning: IsaacGymEnvs | MPC: MJPC\n","wordCount":"730","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-01-06T21:08:12-05:00","dateModified":"2024-01-06T21:08:12-05:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Younghyo Park"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://younghyopark.me/blog/posts/automating-behavior-generation/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Younghyo's Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://younghyopark.me/blog/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://younghyopark.me/blog accesskey=h title="Younghyo's Blog (Alt + H)"><img src=https://younghyopark.me/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Younghyo's Blog</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://younghyopark.me/ title="About Me"><span>About Me</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://younghyopark.me/blog>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://younghyopark.me/blog/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Automating Behavior Generation</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-01-06 21:08:12 -0500 EST'>January 6, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;730 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Younghyo Park</div></header><div class=post-content><h2 id=1-motivation>1.
